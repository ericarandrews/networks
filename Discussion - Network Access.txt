1. Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)
- There are many different international and national organizations, regulatory government organizations, 
and private companies involved in establishing and maintaining physical layer standards. For instance, 
the physical layer hardware, media, encoding, and signaling standards are defined and governed by the...
"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEEE)".
- The electrical characteristics of copper cabling are defined by the "Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)".
- Engineering organizations that define open standards and protocols that apply to the network access layer include...

2. Bandwidth
- Different physical media support the transfer of bits at different rates. Data transfer is usually discussed in terms of 
"bandwidth" and throughput. "Bandwidth" is the capacity of a medium to carry data.


3. Throughput
- "Throughput" is the measure of the transfer of bits across the media over a given period of time.


4. Latency
- "Latency" refers to the amount of time, to include delays, for data to travel from one given point to another.


5. Radio frequency interference (RFI)
- Electromagnetic interference (EMI) or "radio frequency interference (RFI)" - EMI and "RFI" signals can distort and corrupt the 
data signals being carried by copper media. Potential sources of EMI and "RFI" include radio waves and electromagnetic devices, 
such as fluorescent lights or electric motors...


6. Physical media
- On the sending device, it is the role of the data link layer to prepare data for transmission and control how that data accesses 
the "physical media". However, the physical layer controls how the data is transmitted onto the "physical media" by encoding the 
binary digits that represent data into signals.


7. Network Interface Card (NIC)
- "Network Interface Cards (NICs)" - connect a device to the network. Ethernet "NICs" are used for a wired connection...whereas 
WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network) "NICs" are used for wireless.


8. Half-duplex
- Half-duplex communication - Both devices can transmit and receive on the media but cannot do so simultaneously. The "half-duplex" 
mode is used in legacy bus topologies and with Ethernet hubs. WLANS also operate in "half-duplex". "Half-duplex" allows only one device 
to send or receive at a time on the shared medium and is used with contention-based access methods. 


9. Full-duplex
- Full-duplex communications - Both devices can transmit and receive on the media at the same time. The data link layer assumes that 
the media is available for transmission for both nodes at any time. Ethernet switches operate in "full-duplex" mode by default but can 
operate in half-duplex if connecting to a device such as an Ethernet hub.


10. Carrier Sense Multiple Access / Collision Detection (CSMA/CD)
- WLANs, Ethernet LANs with hubs, and legacy Ethernet bus networks are all examples of contention-based access networks. All of these networks 
operate in half-duplex mode. This requires a process to govern when a device can send and what happens when multiple devices send at the same time. 
- The Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) process is used in half-duplex Ethernet LANs.
- Another from of CSMA that is used by IEEE 802.11 WLANs is 'Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA)'.
- Wifi (IEEE 802.11 standard) - Wireless LAN (WLAN) technology, commonly referred to as Wi-Fi. WLAN uses a contention-based protocol known 
as 'Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA)'.
