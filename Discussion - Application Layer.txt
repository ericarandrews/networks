1. Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP)
- Protocol used by a network node to determine the IP address of its Ethernet interfaces in order to facilitatenetwork booting.

- Application Layer Protocols:
Host Configuration Related Protocols: 
--Name: Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP)
--TCP/UDP Port #: UDP 67, 68
--Description: Enables a diskless workstation to discover its own IP address, the IP address of a BOOTP server on the network, 
and a file to be loaded into memory to boot the machine. BOOTP is superseded by DHCP.

2. Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)
- An application layer protocol providing electronic mail services to transfer mail from client toserver and between servers.

- Application Layer Protocols:
Email Related Protocols: 
--Name: Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)
--TCP/UDP Port #: TCP 25
--Description: Enables a diskless workstation to discover its own IP address, the IP address of a BOOTP server on the network, 
and a file to be loaded into memory to boot the machine. BOOTP is superseded by DHCP.

3. Post Office Protocol (POP)
- A protocol that allows a computer to retrieve email from a server.

4. Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP)
- Protocol that describes a method to retrieve email messages. Unlike POP, copies of themessages are downloaded to the client application but the original messages are kept on the server until manually deleted.

5. File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
- Application protocol, part of the TCP/IP protocol stack, used for transferring files between network nodes.FTP is defined in RFC 959.

6. Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP)
- A protocol similar to FTP that provides the transfer of files from one computer to another over a network. 
TFTP is supported by UDP where FTP is supported by TCP.

7. Client-server
- A computer system setup in which tasks are distributed between a service provider (server) and a service user, 
such as a workstation (client). The server is used to store the applications and data and the majority of the computer 
processing is done on the server.

8. Server Message Block (SMB)
- An application level network protocol mainly applied to shared access to files, printers, serial ports, andmiscellaneous communications between nodes on a network.
