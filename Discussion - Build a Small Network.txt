1. Redundancy
- In internetworking, a network architecture designed to eliminate network downtime caused by a single point of failure. 
Redundancy includes the replication of devices, services, or connections that support operations even in the occurrence of a failure.

2. Real-time traffic
- Data traffic that carries signal output as it happens or as fast as possible. 
Real-time traffic is sensitive to latency and jitter.

3. Protocol analyzer
- Network monitoring device gathers information regarding the status of the network and devices attached to it. 
Also known as network analyzer, or packet sniffer.

4. Octet boundary
- The part of an IPv4 address that falls between an octet.

5. Variable Length Subnet Masking (VLSM)
- Ability to specify a different subnet mask for the same network number on different subnets. 
VLSM can help optimize available address space.
