	4.	Does anyone ever remember connecting via dial-up modem?

- Dial-up Telephone: 
An inexpensive option that uses any phone line and a modem. The low bandwidth provided by a dial-up modem connection is usually not 
sufficient for large data transfer, although it is useful for mobile access while traveling.

bandwidth speeds and support more services such as the Internet, phone, and TV. 
The choice of connection varies depending on geographical location and service provider availability.
