1. Octet
- A group of 8 binary bits. It is similar, but not the same as, a byte. One application in computer networking is to use octets to divide 
IPv4 addresses into four components.
- IPv4 Addresses Expressed in Binary:
- Each address consists of a string of 32 bits, divided into four sections called octets.


2. Prefix length
- In IP subnetting, this refers to the portion of a set of IP addresses whose value must be identical for the addresses to be in the same subnet. 
- Expressing network addresses and host addresses with the dotted decimal subnet mask address can become cumbersome. Fortunately, there is an 
alternate shorthand method of identifying a subnet mask called the prefix length.


3. Slash notation
- A method of expressing a network prefix. It uses a forward slash (/) followed by the network prefix, for example, 192.168.254.0/24. This /24 
represents the 24-bit network prefix in slash format.
- Specifically, the prefix length is the number of bits set to 1 in the subnet mask. It is written in “slash notation,” which is a “/” followed by 
the number of bits set to 1. Therefore, count the number of bits in the subnet mask and prepend it with a slash.


4. Network address
- A dotted decimal number defined by the IPv4 protocol to represent a network or subnet. It represents the network that hosts reside in. Also called 
a network number or network ID.
- Address and subnet mask refer to a network. All hosts within the network share the same network address. The host portion is all 0s.


5. Host address
- IPv4 address of a network host. When talking about host addresses, they are the network layer addresses.
- Unique IP addresses assigned to hosts and devices. The host portion always contains assorted 0s and 1s but never all 0s or all 1s.


6. Broadcast address
- Special address reserved for sending a message to all stations. Generally, a broadcast address is a MAC destination address of all ones. Compare with
 multicast address and unicast address.
- A special address that communicates with all hosts in a network. For instance, when a host sends a packet to the network broadcast IPv4 address, all 
other hosts in the network receive the packet. The broadcast address uses the highest address in the network range. The host portion is all 1s.


7. Classful addressing
- A unicast IP address that is considered to have three parts: a network part, a subnet part, and a host part. The term classful refers to the fact that 
the classful network rules are first applied to the address, and then the rest of the address can be separated into a subnet and host part to perform subnetting. 
Originally, IPv4 addresses were divided into five classes, namely, Class A, Class B, Class C, Class D, and Class E. Classful addressing is not generally practiced 
in current network implementations.
- In 1981, Internet IPv4 addresses were assigned using classful addressing as defined in RFC 790, Assigned Numbers. Customers were allocated a network address 
based on one of three classes, A, B, or C. The RFC divided the unicast ranges into specific classes called:
- Class A (0.0.0.0/8 to 127.0.0.0/8)
- Class B (128.0.0.0 /16 to 191.255.0.0 /16)
- Class C (192.0.0.0 /24 to 223.255.255.0 /24)
- There is also a Class D multicast block consisting of 224.0.0.0 to 239.0.0.0 and a Class E experimental address block consisting of 240.0.0.0 to 255.0.0.0.


8. Classless addressing
- An IPv4 addressing scheme that uses a subnet mask that does not follow classful addressing limitations. It provides increased flexibility when dividing ranges of 
IP addresses into separate networks. Classless addressing is considered the best in current network implementations.
- When you assign an IPv4 address to a computer, the operating system examines the address being assigned to determine if this address is a Class A, Class B, or Class C. 
The operating system then assumes the prefix used by that class and makes the default subnet mask assignment. The system in use today is referred to as classless addressing. 
The formal name is Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR, pronounced “cider”). 


9. Tunneling
- Encapsulating an IP packet inside another IP packet.
- Tunneling is a method of transporting an IPv6 packet over an IPv4 network. The IPv6 packet is encapsulated inside an IPv4 packet, similar to other types of data.


10. Dual stack
- A device that is enabled for both IPv4 and IPv6 protocols.
- Dual stack allows IPv4 and IPv6 to coexist on the same network segment. Dual stack devices run both IPv4 and IPv6 protocol stacks simultaneously.
