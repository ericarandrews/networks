The goal of this first lab was primarily to introduce you to Wireshark. 
The following questions will demonstrate that you’ve been able to get Wireshark 
up and running, and have explored some of its capabilities. 
Answer the following questions, based on your Wireshark experimentation:

1. List 3 different protocols that appear in the protocol column in the 
unfiltered packet-listing window in step 7 above. 
- Hypertext Transfer Protocol
- Transmission Control Protocol
- Internet Protocol

2. How long did it take from when the HTTP GET message was sent until the 
HTTP OK reply was received? (By default, the value of the Time column in 
the packet listing window is the amount of time, in seconds, since Wireshark 
tracing began. To display the Time field in time-of-day format, 
select the Wireshark View pull down menu, then select Time Display Format, 
then select Time-of-day.) 
- HTTP GET message was sent - Value of Time Column in packet listing: 23.172841 seconds - Time of Day: 19:00:34.475097
- HTTP OK reply was received - Value of Time Column in packet listing: 23.256979 - Time of Day: 19:00:34.559235

3. What is the Internet address of the gaia.cs.umass.edu (also known as wwwnet.cs.umass.edu)?
What is the Internet address of your computer? 

http://gaia.cs.umass.edu/
GET_HTTP Messages: 
- Source Address: 10.12.14.225 - From computer
- Destination Address: 104.25.230.10 - To gaia.cs.umass.edu

4. Print the two HTTP messages (GET and OK) referred to in question 2 above. 
To do so, select Print from the Wireshark File command menu, and select the “Selected Packet Only” and “Print as displayed” radial buttons, and then click OK.
