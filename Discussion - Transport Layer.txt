1. Port number
- A field in a TCP or UDP header that identifies the application that either send (source port) or should receive (destination port) the data inside the data segment.
- To pass data streams to the proper applications, the transport layer must identify the target application (Figure 9-4). 
To accomplish this, the transport layer assigns each application an identifier called a port number. 
Each software process that needs to access the network is assigned a port number unique to that host.


2. Multiplexing
- A process where multiple digital data streams are combined into one signal.
- Multiplexing divides the data into smaller segments and enables communications from many different users to be interleaved (multiplexed) on the same network.


3. Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
- A Layer 4 protocol of the TCP/IP model, TCP lets applications guarantee delivery of data across a network.
- IP is concerned only with the structure, addressing, and routing of packets. 
IP does not specify how the delivery or transportation of the packets takes place.Transport protocols specify how to transfer messages between hosts. 
TCP/IP provides two transport layer protocols, Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP). 
IP uses these transport protocols to enable hosts to communicate and transfer data.


4. User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
- A connectionless transport layer protocol in the TCP/IP protocol stack. 
UDP is a simple protocol that exchanges datagrams without acknowledgements or guaranteed delivery,requiring that error processing and retransmission be handled.
- IP is concerned only with the structure, addressing, and routing of packets. 
IP does not specify how the delivery or transportation of the packets takes place.Transport protocols specify how to transfer messages between hosts. 
TCP/IP provides two transport layer protocols, Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP). 
IP uses these transport protocols to enable hosts to communicate and transfer data.


5. Connection-oriented
- Term used to describe data transfer that requires the establishment of a virtual circuit.
- TCP is a connection-oriented protocol. 
A connection-oriented protocol is one that negotiates and establishes a virtual connection 
(or session) between source and destination devices prior to forwarding any traffic. 
Through session establishment, the devices negotiate the amount of traffic that can be forwarded at a given time, 
and the communication data between the two can be closely managed.


6. Stateful
- Tracking of actual conversations and their state of the communication session for a protocol, such as TCP.
- TCP is a stateful protocol. A stateful protocol is a protocol that keeps track of the state of the communication session. 
To track the state of a session, TCP records which information it has sent and which information has been acknowledged. 
The stateful session begins with the session establishment and ends when closed with the session termination.


7. Socket
- A logical communications end point within a network device. 
A socket is typically represented by a Layer 3 address and a Layer 4 port number.
- The source and destination ports are placed within the segment. 
The segments are then encapsulated within an IP packet. 
The IP packet contains the IP address of the source and destination. 
The combination of the source IP address and source port number, 
or the destination IP address and destination port number is known as a socket. 
The socket is used to identify the server and service being requested by the client.


8. Three-way handshake
- The process used by TCP to establish a session.
- Hosts track each data segment within a session and exchange information about what data is received using the information in the TCP header. 
TCP is a full-duplex protocol, where each connection represents two one-way communication streams or sessions. 
To establish the connection, the hosts perform a three-way handshake. 
Control bits in the TCP header indicate the progress and status of the connection.The three-way handshake--Establishes that the destination device is present on the network.--Verifies that the destination device has an active service and is accepting requests on the destination port number that the initiating client intends to use.--Informs the destination device that the source client intends to establish a communication session on that port number.


9. Expectational acknowledgement
- Acknowledgement used by TCP where the ACK number is sent back to the source to indicate the next byte that the receiver expects to receive.
- The sequence (SEQ) number and acknowledgement (ACK) number are used together to confirm receipt of the bytes of data contained in the transmitted segments. 
The SEQ number identifies the first byte of data in the segment being transmitted. 
TCP uses the ACK number sent back to the source to indicate the next byte that the receiver expects to receive. 
This is called expectational acknowledgement.


10. Window size
- As filed in the TCP header that is set in a sent segment, signifies the maximum amount of unacknowledged data the host is willing toreceive before the other sending host must wait for an acknowledgement. Used for flow control.
- TCP also provides mechanisms for flow control, the amount of data that the destination can receive and process reliably. 
Flow control helps maintain the reliability of TCP transmission by adjusting the rate of data flow between source and destination for a given session. 
To accomplish this, the TCP header includes a 16-bit field called the window size.
